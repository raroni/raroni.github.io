      This page serves as a scrapbook of a selection of the various software project I have worked on over the years. Some of these are hobby projects while others were made in a academic or professional context.
    </p></section><section><h2>1. Realtime Occlusion Probes using SDF Volumes (2020)</h2><p>Unity Hackweek 2020 my group and I implemented GPU raymarching of signed distance fields stored as 3D textures. We used this to generate directional occlusion probes in realtime.</p><figure><img src="/projects/realtime_sdf_ao.gif" style="max-height: 24rem"/>

      I started this project to solidify my understanding of pathtracing, BRDFs, and importance sampling.
      A few highlights:
    </p><ul><li>Written in Rust.</li><li>Parallel execution using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/crayon">crayon</a>.</li><li>Russian Roulette for path termination.</li><li>Deterministic.</li><li>Diffuse, dielectric, and specular materials.</li><li>Next Event Estimation.</li></ul><figure><img src="/projects/rust_pathtracer.jpg" style="max-height: 24rem"/>

      In realtime computer graphics we are often interested in compressing sets of spherical functions such as an irradiance field.
      In my thesis I evaluated and compared several known spherical function bases such as Spherical Harmonics, Spherical Gaussians and Ambient Cubes.
      The result was a set of recommendations about which encoding techniques to use for particular types of signals (irradiance, radiance, occlusion/visibility, etc.).
    </p><p>
      I received the maximum grade for my report and defence.
      You can read the thesis <a href="http://www.polylab.dk/projects/thesis.pdf">here</a>.

      A machine learning-based denoiser can smooth out variance in lightmaps caused by low sample counts. This allows you to generate good-looking lightmaps much faster since you do not need to wait for convergence.</p><p>
      At Unity Hackweek 2019 my group and I ported the <a href="https://github.com/OpenImageDenoise/oidn">Intel Open Image Denoiser</a> to Unity&#x27;s <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.barracuda.html">Barracuda platform</a> which enabled it to run on the GPU. Our primary goal was to learn about machine learning denoising.

      For our final assignment in a course about parallel computation at university, my group and I wrote an adaptive GPU pathtracer written in C++/CUDA. The pathtracer detects converged pixels and removes them from the working set. Our primary focus was to make this detection and reduction logic as efficient as possible on modern GPUs.

      Lightmap baking involves packing all lightmapped object into a set of lightmaps.
      I devised and implemented a stable packing algorithm that bundled object that were nearby in world space into the same lightmaps.
      The benefit of this is that it makes it possible to batch draw calls more efficiently at runtime.
    </p><p>Due to other priorities at Unity, this feature unfortunately never shipped.</p><figure><img src="/projects/spatially_coherent_packing.gif" style="max-height: 9999rem"/>

Explicit Shape Sampling in Unity&#x27;s Progressive Lightmapper (2018)</h2><p>For Unity Hackweek 2018 my group and I added explicit sampling of disk/sphere/line lights in Unity&#x27;s progressive lightmapper.</p><figure><img src="/projects/shape_sampling.gif" style="max-height: 26rem"/>
<figcaption>Fig 9: Unity&#x27;s progressive lightmapper with explicit sphere sampling.</figcaption></figure></section><section><h2>8. Lightmap Seam Stitching (2017)</h2><p>
      A known problem with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightmap">lightmapping</a> is seam artifacts along the borders of the UV islands that are neighbours in object space but separated in lightmap space.
      To solve this problem in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, I implemented a technique that &quot;stitches&quot; together the seams by performing a least square error minization over the border texels of the UV islands.
      My solution to this was heavily inspired by <a href="http://miciwan.com/SIGGRAPH2013/Lighting%20Technology%20of%20The%20Last%20Of%20Us.pdf">Naughty Dog</a> and <a href="https://www.sebastiansylvan.com/post/LeastSquaresTextureSeams/">Sebastian Sylvan</a>.

      An implementation of the lockstep synchronization algorithm used in some types of networked games.
      By making the simulation (collision detection etc.) fully deterministic on the client, you only need to transmit player actions across the network (as opposed to continuously transmitting the full server state).

      For fun and educational purposes I wrote a game engine from scratch in C++/OpenGL.
      A few highlights:
    </p><ul><li>Platform abstraction layer. Current only MacOS backend is implemented.</li><li>Data-oriented design using the Entity/Component pattern.</li><li>Deferred renderer with Variance Shadow Mapping, Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, and day/night cycle system.</li><li>Includes physics, pathfinding, steering, skeletal animation, and simple behaviour tree system for AI.</li><li>State simulation and rendering are completely decoupled (allowing for deterministic updates).</li></ul><p>Source code is <a href="https://github.com/raroni/Flowstone">available on Github</a>.</p><figure><img src="/projects/hobby_engine_2015.gif" style="max-height: 32rem"/>
