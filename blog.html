      To fully grok non-trivial topics I&#x27;ve always found that it helps to write about it.
      I think that this is because the process of articulation helps you identify holes in your knowledge and such realizations can serve as valuable guides about where to direct your curiosity.

      Therefore the theme of this blog is simply me attempting to casually explain topics that I find interesting.
      I hope someone will learn as much from reading my posts as I do writing them.
