      Below you&#x27;ll find my occupational history. My personal mantra is to stay humble and curious. I try to live by this in my personal and professional life.
    </p><p>
      To get a feel for some of the work that I have done, I recommend you also take a look at my <a href="projects.html">project scrapbook</a>.
    </p></section><section><h2>1. Graphics Engineer at Unity (2015-)</h2><p>
      Working at Unity Technologies has taught me about the constituents of modern game engines.
      I am part of the lighting team where we focus on precomputed global illumination in the form of pathtraced lightmaps and light probes.
    </p><p>I started as a student worker. After my graduation I transitioned into a full-time engineer in August 2019.</p></section><section><h2>2. Computer Science Bachelor at Copenhagen University (2015-2019)</h2><p>
      After being a professional software developer for more than 10 years, I decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/raroni86/status/1145665547759173633">go back to school</a> in order to elevate my skill-set to the next level.
      I studied my ass off for three years with particular focus on algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and parallel computation.
    </p><p>
      Throughout my entire studies I had a student job in Unity&#x27;s lighting team where I turned theory into practical experience.
    </p></section><section><h2>3. iOS App Developer (2014-2015)</h2><p>
      I was part of the effort to launch the iOS app for <a href="https://gomore.dk/">GoMore</a>, Scandinavia&#x27;s leading platform for car-pooling and peer-to-peer car rental.
      The experience taught me the value of close collaboration between designers and programmers.
      On the technical side I gained insight into the technologies driving Apple&#x27;s platforms.
    </p></section><section><h2>4. Self-study and Hobby Game Engines (2013-2014)</h2><p>
      After 10+ years in web-development, I wanted to transition into game engine development.
      I took a hiatus from &quot;real work&quot; to instead study and experiment just for fun.
      During this period I built several hobby game engines in C++/OpenGL and got substantial experience with engine-related subjects such as realtime graphics, low-latency networking, game AI, GPU architecture, and data-oriented design.
    </p></section><section><h2>5. Web Game Entrepreneur (2005-2013)</h2><p>
      During my last year at HTX I developed a web-based MMO football game called <a href="https://www.virtualmanager.com/">Virtual Manager</a>.
      The game was a hit with more than 100.000 active users and this allowed me to build a small company around it.
    </p><p>
      By wearing many hats at once I got experience in various aspects of software development such as leadership, user-centric product design, and how to run a small software business.
    </p></section><section><h2>6. HTX (2002-2005)</h2><p>
      I attended HTX (technical high scool) in Aalborg with focus on math, physics, chemistry, and IT.
    </p></section><section><h2>7. Teenage Projects (1998-2003)</h2><p>
      During my early teens I realized my passion for programming. I particularly enjoyed creating web-based chat worlds and MMO games, and as a result I learnt a lot about managing and optimizing web and database servers.
